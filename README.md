Clean Architecture Design and simple code generator

Clean Architecture reflects a basic directory structure of a Flutter App for 1 - 3

coders. For a bigger project it is recommended to use a module separated structure
(1 module for each architecture layer);

Simple Code Generator shows how it is easy to generate a codebase with dart.

To run the code generator run in terminal the following command:
flutter pub run clean_architecture:os_info_generator
